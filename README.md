# Edge-Chain
Design and implementation of a blockchain architecture, located on the edge, to provide secure support, reliability, monitoring and malicious behavior control of IoT devices.

##:hammer_and_wrench: Technologies
- The smart contract language utilized was [Solidity](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.6.2/) with Solc as Solidity compiler.
- The IoT client was developed using [Java 11] (https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/).
- The Ethereum-Java interface used on the project was [web3j](https://github.com/web3j).
- [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle) was used as a contract migration tool and as a directory manager too.
- [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) was used as a testing blockchain network for the developing phase.
- The final Blockchain network was created using [GoEthereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum).

##:exclamation: Disclaimer
- Currently the documentation is only in Spanish; an English version will be uploaded as soon as I finish one.
- When moving to the Netherlands I forgot to bring my two Blackberry Pi 3b+ with me so, I do not have the last version of the Java client nor the last version of the EdgeChain.sol contract with me. They will be uploaded in my next visit to Spain.
- Solidity is a young and rapidly changing technology so there are high chances of finding obsolete methods in my code.
